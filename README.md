# reusable-ionic-react
Reusable stuff (components, custom hooks and patterns) written in Ionic React

This repository contains experimentation with hybrid app development with Ionic (v7.1.1) using React.
Each subdirectory contains a standalone Ionic React app, which can be locally served by issuing following command -

```
ionic serve
```

Make sure you have Ionic installed on your system using [these instructions](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli).
